# Project 1
Salary Prediction of Data Professions (Regression task)

### Problem Statement 
Salaries in the field of data professions vary widely based on factors such as experience, job role, and 
performance. Accurately predicting salaries for data professionals is essential for both job seekers and 
employers.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the salary_prediction.csv file, it contains detailed information of data Professionals. The dataset was gotten from Mentorness.

### Tools Used
1. Python Programming Language
2. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. Scikit-Learn Library
4. Pipeline 

### Model Performance 
Mean Absolute Error(MAE) of 4462 was achieved, which is a very good performance for the model dynamics 

### Findings 
From my analysis, I discovered that 'age' and 'sex' have little influence on salary. The major factors that influence salary in the field of data Professions are 'work experience', job role and performance ratings.

### Recommendations 
Due to the insight gotten from the analysis, I recommend that as a data Professional or aspiring to be one, you have to hone and advance your skill to attract a good pay.

# Project 2
Fastag Fraud Prediction Model (Classification task)

### Tools Used
1. Python Programming Language
2. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. Scikit-Learn Library

### Data Sources 
The dataset for this analysis was gotten from fastag transaction company, it contains details of transactions over time

### Model Performance 
An accuracy score of 97% was achieved.

### Findings
 The major factors contributing to fraudulent activities are as followed:
 1. Due to my analysis, I discovered that there were ranges of amount paid during the transaction that are fraud, for instance, mostly the amount that were above 200 were not fraud but the amount below 200 were fraud.
 2. Another discovery is that, both 'fraud' and 'not fraud' vehicles shared some speed but fraudulent vehicles had more higher speed of 350km upward.

### Recommendations
From the insight gotten from the analysis, I recommend that each transaction should be checked thoroughly, if it shares the characteristics of past fraudulent transactions, then the transaction should be terminated or given further verification.

### Limitations 
The limitation experienced during the model building is imbalanced dataset (dependent variable) as a result of low occurrence  of fraudulent activities. But that was dealt with by using Random Sampling to balance the dataset.
